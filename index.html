                   I hope you're doing really good whenever you read this, and if you ever aren't,
            <br /> then know that I'll always appreciate how you feel and the oppurtunity to listen
            <br /> if you need that. I'm very proud of you; you're always doing something impressive.
            <br /> I know sometimes its good to be able to relax and not feel the weight of decisions
            <br /> and responsibility and pressure to do the right thing, you can forget it all around
            <br /> me, I hope. I love you as you are and always will.
